After reading through the APIs, I found the following characteristics in common:

1.) Good Documentation
    There was good documentation present in all 5 API’s, which ranged from having a search bar for looking up methods to providing examples and a brief summary of each function’s purpose. Each documentation has their own pros and cons

    Weather API: They break their documentation into 4 parts- overview, examples, updates, and specification. I found their specification useful since they filter their methods by tags, making it easier for development.

    Stripe API: They also have a similar documentation style. However, it appears the Stripe API is easier to navigate through since they provide examples of how to use each request next to the request’s description. Moreover, I found their navigation bar on the side useful since it provides a high overview of the structure of the documentation.

    GitHub API: They also have a navigation bar on the side. One characteristic that stood out to me was their documentation for error handling. I think this would be very useful since developers would have an easier time to debug since they understand their output better.

	CUMTD API: They are also well organized. Though I have not examined each API method closely, it does seem there are not enough methods available. However, this could be beneficial since it makes their documentation concise and simple to use. 

	Queue API: They are very concise. I liked how they described what each object does even though it is self-explanatory based on their names. However, it would have been better if they showed some examples of how to use the requests like the other APIs have. 

    Good Documentation = Concision + Error Handling Info + High Overview + Search Bar


2.) Security: Authentication
	Depending on the application, authentication might be necessary. An API authentication would be beneficial since it protects the client’s information, especially sensitive data, and enables a way for client’s to prove their identity. In all 5 APIs, their documentation included authentication or some form of security. 

	Weather Service: They mention this in their overview tab. It would have been nice if they elaborated more on their authentication

	Stripe: They mention this right after their introduction, creating a smooth flow to their documentation. As mentioned previously, they also provided an example of how to authenticate.

	GitHub: Same as Stripe but they also mention login limit as well.

	CUMTD: They make it very easy to generate an API key 

	Queue: Due to their concision, they also make it easy to generate keys. Although, based on reading the other APIs, it would make sense for them to include their API authentication process at the beginning rather than at the end.

3.) Protective Constraints: Pagination + Rate Limits
	Also depending on the application, pagination might be beneficial. If an application relies on lots of data and analytics, it would put lots of stress on the API. To optimize for efficiency, API pagination is useful for making APIs run smoothly. Documentation regarding pagination was present in Stripe and GitHub.

	Similarly, rate limits protect API from malicious overuse by limiting the number of requests made. This was mentioned in the weather and CUMTD API. 



Google Calendar API
Their API seems easy to navigate, concise for each section, and their documentation structure seems intuitive. They not only define their methods well but also their objects and the objects' relationship to others. Moreover, I have also noticed their documentation style seems to be consistent with other Google APIs.

Yahoo Finance API
The API appears to have a limited number of methods available for developers to use, close to 7 methods available. Interestingly, the documentation not only provides starting code but a video tutorial of the documentation.
